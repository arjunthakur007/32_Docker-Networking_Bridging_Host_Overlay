##What is Docker Networking?
>Allows Containers to communicate with each other and the host system.
 e.g. frontend container has to talk to the backned container.

##Docker Networking v/s VM Networking
>VM has its own O.S. and our App. So each O.S. is isolated from each other.
 We can connect a subnet to each of these O.S. seperately and they will get 
 their own IP address. 

>The Docker container shares the host OS's kernel. Its network interface is 
 just a way to isolate its process from others. The container IPs are only 
 known on the host machine's internal Docker network. When you want to expose 
 a port, you are directly telling the host OS: "Take traffic coming to my 
 public port, and route it instantly to the container's internal port."

##How containers talks to host in terms of nerworking?
>Bridge Networking: 
 Docker uses a special virtual bridge network (often called docker0 or a 
 vEth). When a container starts Docker creates a virtual ether network
 to create link between App and Host(eth0) network (both on different subnets). This 
 network is internal to the host. 
 Bridge network is the default Docker Network.

>Host Networking:
 Containers will directly use the eth0 network of the Host. 
 However this has security issues like No Firewall Separation, Access to 
 all Interfaces, No Port Mapping, Hardcoded Ports etc.

>Overlay Networking:
 Too complicated for now, will be covered later.
